    <!-- DESCRIPTION-->

    RoboSwiffer is a robotic swiffer developed using Bluetooth communication, ultrasonic sensors and limit switches to map rooms and avoid obstacles. The project was completed for the 1A end of term design
    symposium.  I was the lead software developer and in charge of the majority of the testing and debugging.  The robot was built with two NXT bricks, a laser cut and 3D printed frame.
    We used PID feedback for consistent motor values and proper heading. The robot used sensor feedback to map the room and self generate a path.
    <br> <br>
    Path generation was complicated given the platform and sensors that we had to work with.  The algorithm that I ended up writing involved taking the perimeter of the room using the touch sensors, and then dividing
    that into travelable segments.  The code proceeded to constantly check for an unexpected touch sensor press (ie. an obstacle).  The robot would then pivot its ultrasonic sensor around to map the dimensions of an obstacle and proceed to avoid it, and then return to its initially devised path.

    <br> <br>
    This video showed the RoboSwiffer taking the perimeter of the room and then proceeding to follow its first path, all the while skirting the box.

    <!-- DESCRIPTION-->
    The RoBoat is a ROS operated motorboat. The software package I designed lets you control the rotation of the prop and the motor speed with the keyboard. It also lets you visualize gyro data in

    RVIZ, as well as displaying ultrasonic sensor data as a cone. The Arduino code prints the gyro data and ultrasonic data through serial for the package to read and
    then display in RVIZ.  This was very interesting to code as previous Arduino-to-ROS programs rely on the rosserial library.  I started having issues with the
    library when declaring a node on the Arduino and it used half the board's dynamic memory, which impacted the reliability of the sensor data.  I did a lot of research and edited an existing
    package to allow for a direct serial communication between the Arduino and ROS, allowing the node to be declared on the computer instead.  This increased the reliability of the sensor data.
    This alternative method reduced the Arduino Uno's dynamic memory usage by 50%. I was the sole software developer for this project.
    <br> <br>
    These screenshots show the visualization of the gyro and ultrasonic data as I rotate the Arduino.

    This video showed the boat with the full prop setup.  It was taken while I manipulated motor values with the keyboard.  During the video I moved the Arduino around to show
    how the orientation changed in the visualizer.  It also showed the ultrasonic cone as I moved that sensor closer and farther away from the wall.

                                I was responsible for the ROS development of an intelligent walker for the elderly.  The goal of the walker was
                            to be able to guide a person to a destination and avoid obstacles.  The software was designed to read intent from the person's
                            grip on the handles and determine a goal based on where they were trying to go.  The walker would then plan a path to the destination
                            accounting for obstacles and turn radius etc.  Research and programming were focused on Kinect V2 based Vision systems, and Ackermann
                            drivetrain based path planning and steering algorithms.  I also machined a handle, and support while additionally designing a preliminary walker model using SolidWorks.

                                <br> <br>
                                I used SLAM to create real time maps with Kinect V2 for mapping using Gmapping and RTabMap.  The maps were then processed for obstacles and used to provide visual odometry.
                                <br> <br>

                               I worked with Neural Networks and object recognition to identify objects, as well as recognize desirable goals and set those as goals in the path planner.

                                I created the ROS package from scratch; it contained a URDF for Gazebo and RVIZ built from STLs exported from SolidWorks, as well as relevant control packages for wheels.
                                
                                I also wrote Arduino Code to use a Bluetooth mobile app to control the simulation, as well as code to take measurements from strain sensors on the handles and relate them to motor speeds.

                            My Co-op was split between embedded work, and software development.
                            For the embedded half, I designed, prototyped, programmed and built a case for a power module tester.
                            The forestry machines we worked with are installed with a Power Management Module that controls the Telematics unit's state.
                            In order to ensure that this unit was not defective, I was tasked with developing a tester for it.
                            The tester applies different voltages to different pins on the Power Module, and reads its responses.
                            Based off of 4 pre-programmed test cases, the tester lights up its four BiColour LEDs differently.
                            <br> <br>
                            The case was 3D printed and designed in SolidWorks, while the schematic and PCB design were done in KiCAD.  The code was run from an Arduino Nano.

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/CircuitComplete.png" alt="">

                            The buttons controlled the tests' start, while the Boost and Step Down converters were used to change the 12V input into 3.3V
                            for the Arduino and 26V for the Power Module.  Consequently the relay was used to control the 26V supply.

                            The BiColour LEDs were charlieplexed to reduce the number of used IO pins.  The LEDs were then turned on and off every 2 milliseconds
                            (run from an interrupt), based on the value of a stored byte (corresponding to the results of the test cases).

                            The other half of my work was on the Manufacturing Preparatory Application for the Telematics Modules.  These modules were received
                            with default firmware on them, but needed to be loaded with custom Tigercat Firmware and machine specific information.  This application was used in-house
                            and only by shop floor workers.  I designed the application with the help of another student, to make it as user-friendly and easy for the workers.  The installation
                            process for these devices was quite complicated and took about 30 minutes to finish once started.  I designed methods for data transfer via SSH, remote/automated
                            interactions with the Telematics Database, decrypting encrypted files, and accessing different REST APIs.
                            <br><br>
                            As well as completing that application, I designed a separate, more advanced version for use in the field.  Machines with outdated firmware were proving unresponsive
                            to remote updates, so I designed a "one-click" application that ran based on pre-loaded information.  This was necessary because the company's database was unavailable abroad.
                            Since the outdated firmware had so many bugs, I coded the portable prep app to handle every possible thing that could go wrong, which involved writing workarounds for many specific issues.
                            This turned into an unbelievably effective and robust piece of software for updating firmware and repairing broken machines.

                            I helped found the team in May 2016 because I hated that I didn't have time to sail anymore in university because it didn't relate to my program.  The creation of this team helped me link
                            my two favourite things: sailing and robotics.  The team has around 10 members and we are going through a large on-boarding and recruitment process.  Our first competition was in June 2017
                            , at the International Robotics Sailing Regatta.  We came 2nd in Canada, 1st out of all rookie teams and 6th overall (out of 11).  The above boat was our first competition vessel, named Lil Yachty.

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/controller.jpg" alt="">
                            Most functionality for our first competition was due to our remote control code, autonomy is very much in development.  The goal for 2018 is to have a functioning path planning algorithm for GPS
                            based goal setting, for which design is already underway.  The other major software goal for 2018 is to integrate some object location using two RGB cameras mounted on the front of the boat.  This
                            functionality will be used for challenges associated with buoy detection and collision avoidance.  I am managing the team responsible for this and helping them to integrate it into our current system.

                            I have also been responsible for most electronic design and hardware decision of our past and current boat.  As the team grows I will be focus most specifically on system architecture, sensor integration
                            and navigation.  Above is a flowchart of our current electronics layout for 2018.

                            For 2018 we are designing a 2m long monohull with a 1.5m keel in order to drop our center of gravity as low as possible, so that we can generate the most lift possible.  This new boat will also feature new
                            software features as mentioned above.  Most notably I am designing and implementing a path planning algorithm for GPS based navigation.  The interesting challenge about autonomous sailing is that boats cannot
                            sail directly into the wind, so in order to get to a goal they need to create an optimized zig zag path to that waypoint.  Our system, built on ROS, keeps updating wind positions based on data from the wind vane
                            on the back of the boat.  The path planner generates our required heading based on info from our on-board GPS and IMU, and that heading in turn sets rudder positions.  When a marker is directly upwind, the planner generates
                            a series of reachable waypoints that regenerate everytime the wind shifts.

                            This team has allowed me to grow as a leader and understand how to delegate and manage a group of people in order to successfully raise money, recruit and compete with a fully functional boat.  Designing an entire
                            software system from scratch has helped me learn a lot about how to make design decisions and how best to create systems that are easy to modify or build on in the future.

                            During my co-op I worked on both image rectification and light distribution correction.  First: Image Leveling.  As you can see above, I devised an algorithm to aid in the correction of
                            vignetting in underwater images taken by our underwater camera.  This was done using a linear approximation of the light distribution and OpenCV.  It was not extremely accurate due to this
                            linear approximation of the distribution.  To make this algorithm more robust and useful, I decided to create a simulator to get the exact light distribution given the orientation and
                            position of the underwater LEDs.
                            <br> <br>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/led_flowchart.png" alt="">

                            The steps for this algorithm were as follow:
                            <br> <br>
                            1.	Use camera pinhole effect to project each of the camera's pixels onto the seabed.  Use this to get the position of each pixel and its distance to the camera.
                            <br> <br>
                            2.	Use ray tracing techniques to determine the intensity of a specific point on the seaplane. This will be done by drawing back a vector to the LED, calculating
                            that vectors angle, and using the candela distribution find its intensity.  Distance of the point to the LED must also be output.
                            <br> <br>
                            3.	Using the information from Step 1 and Step 2, figure out the intensity of each pixel knowing each pixel's position on the seabed, the distance the light travels
                            to the plane, and the distance the pixel is from the camera.  The position of the pixel will then be fed into the algorithm for Step 1, which will determine that point’s intensity.
                            This step will output a map of intensities per pixel.

                            <br> <br>
                            Another simulator was also written for a panel of LEDs that had one big cylindrical viewport.  This had to follow a different method because of refraction through the viewport.  A MonteCarlo
                            simulator was designed to handle this problem, and worked by projecting billions of rays randomly (biased to the distribution of the LED intensity curve).  These rays were then summed on the seafloor
                            and assigned to the nearest camera pixel.
                            <br> <br>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-md-6">
                                    <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/OldPanelDist.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-md-6">
                                    <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/NewPanelDist.png" alt="">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            The simulator was meant generate the light distribution based on the position of 48 LEDs but the entire reason it was designed was to create a more even light distribution on the seafloor, so that
                            image rectification would not even be needed.  This simulator let us move around the LEDs until we could find the best possible distribution.  Above are the before and after results, please note that
                            the photos are scaled so that all the intensities are mapped between 0-255, meaning that a black pixel does not mean that no light reaches that pixel, just that it is the darkest. The metrics for the final
                            panel are MAX: 91.9699 MIN: 36.037 AVERAGE: 67.6048.
